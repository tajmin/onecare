A network of people who love, and support, and count on one other to be there. Everybody means the world to someone and we are committed to care for others so they can be there for the ones they love. With nearly 35,000 employees across regions of Ohio and Kentucky, we’re one of the largest health care systems in the country. At each of our more than 600 points of care, we deliver high-quality, compassionate care with one united purpose: to help our patients be well in mind, body and spirit. </p>

                        <p> OneCare is a mission-driven organization committed to making every patient’s life better — mind, body and spirit. Delivering high quality patient care is central to our Mission and to our ministry.

                            As the largest health system in Ohio and one of the largest nonprofit healthcare ministries in the United States, we never stop trying to do an even better job of caring for those we serve.

                            With this in mind, we have established a clear goal — that OneCare services will reduce variation and achieve at least top quartile performance as measured across all the STEEEP aims from the Institute of Medicine. These universal best practices aim for care that is Safe, Timely, Effective, Efficient, Equitable and Patient-centered.

                            <br />  <br />
                            OneCare continually strives to improve the quality and safety of our care by implementing these measures: We track our progress with regard to nationally designated quality measures, including the recommended elements of evidence-based care to prevent surgical infections and to treat heart attack, heart failure and pneumonia.

                            Our Performance Improvement Collaboratives, which are based on the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Breakthrough Series Collaborative model, bring together leaders and clinicians throughout OneCare to achieve breakthrough progress in areas such as perinatal, emergency care, perioperative and care coordination.
                            <br /> <br />
                            We have implemented EPIC CarePATH, a dynamic electronic health record (EHR) that enables coordinated patient care and up-to-date information-sharing among physicians' offices, the emergency department, and inpatient and outpatient hospital care teams.

                            Our EHR also allows us to build in functions such as medication scanning and clinical alerts to prevent harm and provide safer care. Through the use of performance improvement strategies such as Lean Six Sigma, we are redesigning clinical processes to make them more efficient and effective and to increase our capability to provide safe care with a high degree of reliability. We have established executive academies and education that enhance our leaders’ abilities to lead the way to safer, more effective care. We provide patient safety training in teamwork and communication to help clinicians acquire a comprehensive set of evidence-based communication tools and teamwork strategies.
